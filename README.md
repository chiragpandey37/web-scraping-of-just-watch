To ensure that your code blocks render properly in a Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) file when viewed on GitHub, you should use triple backticks for code blocks and markdown cells for text. Below is a step-by-step guide to creating a README in a Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Open a new or existing Jupyter Notebook.**

2. **Create Markdown Cells for the README content:**
   - Click on the "+" button to add a new cell.
   - Change the cell type to "Markdown" by selecting it from the dropdown menu.

3. **Add the README content:**

```markdown
# JustWatch Web Scraping Project

## Overview

This repository contains a web scraping project that extracts movie and TV show data from the JustWatch website starting from the year 2000. The goal of this project is to collect comprehensive data about streaming content, including details such as titles, genres, release dates, streaming platforms, and more.

## Features

- Scrape movie and TV show data from JustWatch.
- Collect information on titles, genres, release dates, and streaming platforms.
- Organize and save data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `BeautifulSoup4`
  - `pandas`
 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/justwatch-web-scraping.git
   cd justwatch-web-scraping
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure your working directory is set to the root of the project.

2. Run the scraper:
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

3. The scraped data will be saved in the `data` directory in your preferred format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

4. **Save the Notebook:**
   - Save the notebook with a meaningful name, such as `README.ipynb`.

5. **Verify Rendering on GitHub:**
   - Push the notebook to your GitHub repository.
   - Navigate to the notebook file in your GitHub repository to verify that it renders correctly.

By following these steps, your code blocks and markdown should render properly when viewed on GitHub.
